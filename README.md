# Horiseon Code Refactoring Project

# Description 
This is a code refactoring assignment to encourage use of more semantic HTML tags and meet accessibility requirements 

## How did I achieve this?

- I replaced many of the divs and classes with other tags such as header/section/aside/footer 

- I added alt descriptions of images and icons on the webpage

- I edited the CSS to select the new tags used in the HTML

- I added comments in to the code to help my own readability and be clear what was changed
